yarn add react-test-renderer enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 enzyme-to-json --dev


react-test-renderer:
--------------------
This package provides an experimental React renderer that can be used to render 
React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment.

Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the "DOM tree" rendered by a React DOM 
or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom.


enzyme-to-json:
--------------
Convert Enzyme wrappers to a format compatible with Jest snapshot testing.
